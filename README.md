Lithium-Ion Battery Single Particle Model Tutorial 

Lithium-Ion Battery Single Particle Model is the code to simulate the lithium-ion battery cell model.  

The code contains various models. 

1) Finite Difference Method Model without Degradation. (FDM Model) 
2) Finite Difference Method Model with Linearized Degradation. (FDM LM Model) 
3) Finite Difference Method Model with Nonlinear Degradation. (FDM NM Model) 
4) Pade Approximation Model without Degradation (Pade Model) 
5) Pade Approximation Model with Degradation (Pade-D Model) 
6) Optimization-Based Model (O-B Model)

2) MATLAB File 

To run the code, open the file ‚ÄúRUN\_ROM\_battery\_cell.m‚Äù Following steps are the setup to run the battery cell model. 

1) You have to choose what model you are going to run. (FDM Model, FDM\_LM Model, FDM\_NM Model etc.) 

![](Aspose.Words.216cfff8-f125-45da-a508-b96c3d48f685.005.jpeg)

2) After you choose the battery cell model, you have to select what parameters you are going to use. Skip this part if you select the model that does not contain a degradation model 

In this code, we have two options. First is ‚ÄòSD‚Äô (General Parameters). Second is ‚ÄòBD‚Äô (Increased Parameters)

3) Select the model‚Äôs order 

FDM Model & FDM LM Model

FDM NM Model 

![](Aspose.Words.216cfff8-f125-45da-a508-b96c3d48f685.008.png)

In FDM NM Model, we have to load the nonlinear map to calculate the negative surface concentration. There are two nonlinear maps. 'degradation\_map\_SD.mat' is for ‚ÄòSD‚Äô. 

'degradation\_map\_BD.mat' is for ‚ÄòBD‚Äô. 

Pade Model & Pade-D Model

O-B Model

4) Setup the input current 

![](Aspose.Words.216cfff8-f125-45da-a508-b96c3d48f685.011.png)

If you want to use the 1-D look up table block you have to setup the ‚Äòt‚Äô and ‚Äòu‚Äô variables. 

![](Aspose.Words.216cfff8-f125-45da-a508-b96c3d48f685.012.png)

Or you can setup the various input current using Simulink block as shown above. (Sinusoid wave, square wave etc.) 

5) Initial Condition 

In initial condition part, the only thing you have to change is ‚Äúline 137‚Äù.

6) Linearized side reaction current density coefficients (minor step)
